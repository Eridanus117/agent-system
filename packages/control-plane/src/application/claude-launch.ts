/**
 * `[Story 4.3]` Fresh-target launch/observe for the Claude Code adapter
 * (AD-20's `fresh` branch). Deliberately isomorphic to `application/
 * launch.ts`'s OMP flow (`prepareLaunchPlan`/`launchOmp`) -- same shared
 * `domain/activation.ts` state machine (`createLaunchPlan`/
 * `transitionLaunchPlan`), same `prepared -> awaiting-confirmation ->
 * applying -> observing -> succeeded|degraded|failed|incomplete` lifecycle
 * -- but never routed through `resolveClientSupport`/`prepareLaunchPlan`/
 * `launchOmp` themselves. Two reasons:
 *
 *  1. `[Story 4.6]` `resolveClientSupport('claude-code')` now returns
 *     `supported: true` (this file's own adapter, delivered across
 *     Story 4.1~4.5b, is exactly what makes that true) -- but these
 *     entrypoints still never route through it. This file's launch
 *     entrypoints are Claude-specific already (calling
 *     `prepareClaudeFreshLaunchPlan` at all *is* the "this client is
 *     supported here" signal), so re-checking that generic gate here would
 *     be redundant, not load-bearing. `tests/application/launch.test.ts`'s
 *     "不支持的客户端" case now pins `codex-cli` instead (see
 *     `tests/domain/client.test.ts` for the flipped `claude-code`
 *     assertion).
 *  2. `launchOmp` is hardcoded to OMP's own ports/argv-building/skills-only
 *     assembly story; forking a small, explicit set of Claude-specific
 *     functions here (mirroring its structure, not its OMP-specific
 *     content) is safer than trying to generalize `launch.ts` into a
 *     multi-client function and risking the ~344 existing OMP tests that
 *     already pin its exact behavior.
 *
 * `confirmLaunchPlan`/`rejectLaunchPlan` (from `application/launch.ts`) are
 * reused as-is (not duplicated) -- both operate purely on `LaunchPlan` via
 * `LaunchDeps` (`configRepository`/`launchPlanRepository`) and never touch
 * `resolveClientSupport` or any OMP-specific port, so they are already
 * client-agnostic.
 *
 * `[Story 4.4]` This file also carries AD-20's other launch target,
 * `prepareClaudeAlreadyRunningLaunchPlan` (the `already-running` branch):
 * unlike `launchClaudeFresh`, it never reaches `awaiting-confirmation`/
 * `applying`/`observing` at all -- it resolves a plan straight from
 * `prepared` to the existing `requires-restart` terminal phase via
 * `domain/activation.ts`'s `target-requires-restart` event, needs none of
 * `LaunchClaudeFreshDeps`' probe/spawn/context/invocation-dir ports, and
 * takes only the plain `LaunchDeps` this file already imports for
 * `prepareClaudeFreshLaunchPlan`.
